      <section class="about">
        <p>
          Accomplished and enthusiastic software engineer with over ten years of
          hands-on development experience. As a self-taught developer, I am
          proactive, adaptable and always ready to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience includes contributing to a variety of commercial
          applications; from bespoke internal dashboards to full enterprise
          platforms that serve hundreds of thousands of active customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          My most recent roles have included being the tech lead for mixed
          discipline teams. I have enjoyed both the challenge of handling
          multiple tech operations as well as the mentoring of junior
          colleagues. I like to lead by example and create a productive office
          environment.

        <p>
          A positive and social team culture is important to me. I like to
          regularly work in office where possible, and take part in socials.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time I enjoy playing board and card games with friends. I
          like to keep in touch with colleagues from previous jobs, and we
          regularly attend game nights and pub quizzes. I try to keep fit by
          swimming 2-3 times a week, and I also join walking trips.
