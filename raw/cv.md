<section class="about">

Accomplished and enthusiastic software engineer with over ten years of hands-on development experience. As a self-taught
developer, I am proactive, adaptable and always ready to learn.

My experience includes contributing to a variety of commercial applications; from bespoke internal dashboards to full
enterprise platforms that serve hundreds of thousands of active customers.

My most recent roles have included being the tech lead for mixed discipline teams. I have enjoyed both the challenge of
handling multiple tech operations as well as the mentoring of junior colleagues. I like to lead by example and create a
productive office environment.

## Interests

A positive and social team culture is important to me. I like to regularly work in office where possible, and take part
in socials.

In my free time I enjoy playing board and card games with friends. I like to keep in touch with colleagues from previous
jobs, and we regularly attend game nights and pub quizzes. I try to keep fit by swimming 2-3 times a week, and I also
join walking trips.
