      <section class="about">
        <p>
          Accomplished and enthusiastic software engineer with over ten years of
          hands-on development experience. As a self-taught developer, I am
          proactive, adaptable and always ready to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience includes contributing to a variety of commercial
          applications; from bespoke internal dashboards to full enterprise
          platforms that served hundreds of thousands of active customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most recently my work has included being the tech lead for mixed
          discipline teams. I’ve enjoyed both the challenge of handling multiple
          tech operations as well as the mentoring of my junior colleagues.
          Positive and social team culture is important to me, I like to be in
          office where possible and I enjoy taking part in socials.
