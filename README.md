<section class="about">

I am a proficient and enthusiastic software engineer with many years of hands-on web development experience. I am
self-taught, proactive, and always willing to learn new things.

I have worked professionally on a variety of commercial applications, ranging from bespoke internal dashboards to full
enterprise platforms serving several hundred thousand active customers.

For the last few years, I have also been the tech lead for mixed discipline teams. I like to create an enjoyable working
environment for my colleagues, lead by example, and encourage others to work to the best of their ability.
